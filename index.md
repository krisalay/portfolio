### Machine Learning
#### **Emotion-Responsive Brain-Computer Interface Music Player**
We designed and developed a cutting-edge Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) music player that intuitively adapts music selection based on the user's emotional state. This innovative project leveraged various machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine algorithms, for the recognition of human emotions through a 2D emotion classifier. To capture brain signals, We engineered a custom electronic band featuring EEG electrodes, instrumentation amplifiers, and advanced noise reduction circuits. Furthermore, We created a responsive web application for real-time synchronization and simulation of brain signal activities.

**Key Achievements:**
-   Developed a sophisticated emotion recognition model using Support Vector Machine algorithms, enabling the BCI system to accurately decipher a user's emotional state from EEG data.
-   Designed a user-friendly web application that offers real-time brain signal monitoring, enhancing the overall user experience.
-   Custom-built an electronic band for non-invasive EEG data acquisition, with a focus on signal fidelity and user comfort.
-   Successfully integrated hardware and software components to create an end-to-end BCI system that seamlessly interprets human emotions and curates a personalized music playlist.
